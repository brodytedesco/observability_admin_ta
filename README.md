# Observability Admin TA

# Developed using the Splunk UCC Framework with support from the UCC Framework Team (UCC Framework Documentation), this Splunk Technology Add-on (TA) bridges platform data from Splunk Observability into Splunk Core.

The primary objective is to enable administrators to monitor their platforms from a single, unified tool (Splunk Core), leveraging its superior data transformation and customizable alerting capabilities. The app includes modular inputs and dashboards for seamless integration and functionality.

Popular Use Cases
- Alerting on Token Expiry: Provides custom alerting options for token expiration, overcoming the limitations of non-configurable default alerting in Splunk Observability.
- Monitoring Synthetic Status: Offers visibility into the health and performance of synthetic monitoring.
- Change Auditing: Simplifies the process of retrieving and auditing changes to objects within Splunk Observability, making this data point readily accessible.
